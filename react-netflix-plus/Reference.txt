  Components
  ---
    1. Functional Components
        * coded as functions

        1.1 Functional components with Named Function
        1.2 Functional components with Anonymous Function
        1.3 Functional components with Arrow Function

        * were called as Stateless Components (Before React V 16.8) and dumb components 
        * Now, states are possible in Fn components (After React V 16.8)

    2. Class Components
        * coded as classes in JS 
        * are called as stateful components 
        * are smart components and containers

  7 Characteristics

    1. Pages should not reload/refresh [DONE]
    2. URL should be changed [DONE]
    3. Browser History should be maintained [DONE]
    4. Retain Header and Footer [DONE]
    5. The content in b/w header and footer should be updated [DONE]
    6. Active menu should be set [TODO]
    7. Page Title should be changed [TODO]


Routing 
---
  Step 0:
  --
    Identify the menus

    Menu: Home      URL:localhost:3000/      
    Menu: About     URL:localhost:3000/about       
    Menu: Contact   URL:localhost:3000/contact 

  Step 1:
  --- 
    Let's setup the URLs in Menu comp 

  Step 2:
  ---
    npm i react-router-dom 

  Step 3:
  --
    Identify the URLs and matching components

    localhost:3000/         -- Home Component 
    localhost:3000/about    -- About Component
    localhost:3000/contact  -- Contact Component

    We need to create Home, About and Contact Components

  Step 4:
  --
    Let's configure the URL in App.js 
    
    <BrowserRouter>
      <div>
        <Header></Header>

        <div className="mt-5 container">
          <Routes>
            <Route path='/' element={ <Home /> }/>
            <Route path='/about' element={<About />} />
            <Route path='/contact' element={<Contact />} />
          </Routes>
        </div>
        
        <Footer />
      </div>
    </BrowserRouter>

  Step 5: 
  --
    Check the app. Pages will refresh. Fix it by replacing <a href> with <Link to>

React Hooks
---
A new concept was introduced in React 16.8 - Hooks. 
They let you use state and other React features without writing a class.
Many of the features available to classes - such as lifecycle methods and states - 
are not available to functional components. 
The hooks introduced in react adds all that functionality and more.

Life Cycle Hooks and React Hooks are not same. 

This feature has loads of cools things to even replace redux .
In this example, let's build a few things just by using hooks, 
a potential alternative to redux.

Hooks enable a functional component to have state in it.
This is also called as Hook state. 

Example: 
  within a fn comp, 

  import {useState } from 'react';

  //this is a data in a variable.. not a state.
  const myProfile = {
    name: 'Arun',
    city: 'Chennai'
  }

  // to have state inside fn comp, we can use useState() . 
  // this will take in data and return getter and setter in an array. 
  // We can do array destructuring to capture both.
  const [profile, setProfile] = useState(myProfile);

  const [age, setAge] = useState(20); // valid -- can create multiple

  // then, we can log 
  console.log(profile);

  const updateProfile = () => {
    setProfile({
      name: 'VJ',
      city: 'Chennai'
    });
    console.log(profile);
  }

  And have a button in JSX to call updateProfile method.
    <button type='button' onClick={updateProfile}>Update Profile</button>

Rules of Hooks
---------------
Hooks are JavaScript functions, but they impose two additional rules:

Only call Hooks at the top level. 
Don’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.
Only call Hooks from React functional components. 
Don’t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions. 
(There is just one other valid place to call Hooks — your own custom Hooks.)

=======================

useState() Hook 
---

useEffect() - Hook 
  is what componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate to class comp 
  will get executed after render cycle 
  useEffect( () => {
    console.log('test');
  })


useCallback()
Hook prevents the child component rendering if the dependency is not changed at all

Important one for performance optimization

useContext()
Let's us share data across components 

Step 1: create context with any data or even null inside 
Refer: PageContext.js 

Step 2: Provide the data to the list of components you want to share 
Check App.js 

Step 3: Using <PageContext.Provider> to share the data across the few components 

Step 4: Consume it in both Home.js and About.js
